Our code presents two distinct games on the start screen: a reaction time test and a timer-based challenge. In the reaction time test, targets appear at various locations with a one-minute countdown, assessing how many targets you hit. In the timer game, you aim to hit 15 targets while the timer increases. Missing a target deducts a heart (three hearts total); after losing all hearts, it's game over.
